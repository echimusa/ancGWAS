# ancGWAS
ancGWAS is an algebraic graph-based method to identify the most significant sub-network underlying ethnic difference in complex diseases risk in a recently admixed population. This approach integrates the association signal from a GWAS data set, the local ancestry, and SNP pair-wise linkage disequilibrium from the admixed population into the PPI network.
